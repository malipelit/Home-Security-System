# Home Security System
## Executive Summary
Have you ever told yourself that "I can not live in a house on the ground floor" because of the possible burglary cases? You are not alone since this idea is widespread. Even, there is the fact that lower rent money is being wanted for the houses on the ground floor. When the statistics are checked, the crime rate of theft has been increasing year by year. From 2008 to 2012, the crime of theft has increased around 60% (worldwide). This situation forces us to live in more secure homes. Residents want to know what happens around their houses at any time. Moreover, residents want to feel safe when they are sleeping or on vacation. The innovation of technologies provides different solutions to this problem. At this exact point, PikachuTECH - Home Security System offers innovative solutions for you (the residents). In the Home Security System, face recognition is being used to detect the faces of newcomers with a camera. The images of residents will be processed in order to create a database. Then, when the newcomer is not identified as a resident, the residents will be notified about this situation via Mail/SMS/Notification on a mobile application. The residents will tag newcomers as residents, one-time visitors, permanent visitors, or intruders. The motion around the house up to 5 meters will be detected with the help of Passive-Infrared technology. Any intrusive activities (such as carrying a gun, standing around the house for a while, approaching the camera, etc.) will be reported to the residents directly with the help of image processing. There will be a buzzer system and alarm system if any intrusion activities occur. Moreover, the whole logs of entries and exits of the person to the house will be recorded in the database with their tag. This entire project is straightforward and does not need complicated tools. The process described above only has two cameras, one processor (Jetson Nano), and additional sensors (such as HC SR04 ) that are easy to implement. Do not think of "Big Brother is Watching Us" since the resident's privacy is always protected. Moreover, the whole database and logs belong are reported to the residents.
